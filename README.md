# micro-PKC (Personal Knowledge Container)
Author: inblockio / 23. August 2021

Installation for Linux (Tested in Ubuntu 20.04) of your Personal Knowledge Container\
This should work for other environments like Windows and Mac if the requirements are met.
## Requirements

1. install git: sudo apt-get install git
2. install docker. Follow: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
3. `git clone https://github.com/inblockio/micro-PKC`
## Installation

1. `cd micro-PKC`
2. Run `./pkc setup --wallet-address <your wallet address>`

If you want to install the PKC so that it is publicly accessible from the web:
1. Register your subdomains, e.g. `pkc.yourdomain.com` and `eauth.yourdomain.com` to the public IP address of your server
2. Run `./pkc setup --web-public --wallet-address <your wallet address> --server <mediawiki.domain> --eauth-server <eauth.domain> --le-email <your@email.com>`

Other flags:
1. `./pkc setup --private` is setting the wiki into private mode by default. Except the main page all pages will not be visible to not registered users.
2. `./pkc setup --empty-wiki` will not pre-populate the wiki from https://github.com/inblockio/PKC-Content which includes default pages for how to use the PKC and other helpful resources.
3. `./pkc --nuke` is a command which deletes the mountpoint (the persistent data) and deletes the current instances of the docker containers.

**Test if deployment was successful:**\
Go to localhost:9352 and see if you can open your 'Personal Knowledge Container'\
If the special pages work, congratulations! You successfully deployed PKC!
